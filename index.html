            <h1>How to work it! ðŸš˜</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Instead of providing a detailed step by step explanation (because i'm lazy and truth be told not super
                fluent in this yet), here's a simplified summary of how the
                simulation works.</p>

            <h2>Parallelizations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A set number of cars (defined by <code>n</code>) are sent forward with the goal of navigating
                    through traffic.</li>
                <li>These cars are referred to as parallelizations, representing alternate scenarios or potential paths
                    the car could take.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Selecting the Best Car</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Among all the parallelizations, one car is expected to be superior due to the inherent randomness of
                    the neural network.</li>
                <li>Each car undergoes a unique mutation, and the best car is determined by the one that has progressed
                    the furthest, measured by its Y value.</li>
                <li> In other words, higher the y value the more "performant" the car is.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Saving the Best Car</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When you identify a high-performing car, click the save button (ðŸ’¾) to preserve it as your best car.
                </li>
                <li>All future iterations/parallelizations will use this saved car as a base.</li>
                <li>Each new mutation will slightly adjust the neural network parameters of this base car.</li>
                <li>Continue saving the top-performing car until you achieve one that completes the course.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Deleting the Best Car</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I highly recommend that before starting your first run, you click the discard (ðŸš®) button to "wipe
                    the slate clean". This ensures that there are no cars defined as the best yet.</li>
                <li>This feature is best used in case you accidentally save a mutation that you would rather not have
                    (maybe the mutation is boring, bugged, etc.).</li>
                <li>Note that this doesn't need to be used before saving a new best car, as the save function overwrites
                    whatever your last best car was.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Visualization</h2>
            <p>The visualization on the right demonstrates the current car's "thought process." It shows how the neural
                network and its layers interact to generate the output, translating inputs into decisions.</p>
